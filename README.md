## The project

This project has been created in _2019_ for me to easily run a **steam idler 24/7** in the background while using **almost no resources**. this project has been reworked in _2022_ adding a lot of new options like the "**staticIdler**" and "**dynamicIdler**" idlers. The only thing that was missing was **multi account support**. This has been added in the rewrite from _2023_ and now known as SteamIdler V2.

## Requirements

- `git` command line ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)|[Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)|[MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)) installed
- `node` version 8.0.0 or higher ([get here](https://nodejs.org))

> If you have 2AF on for you steam account, you need to provide it while the program is starting. A message will appear about it.

## Download code

Run the following command in a CMD/terminal at the location where you want to download it:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZixeSea/SteamIdler.git
```

> Remember to go in to the config folder and chnage/add a config file (for example: **`src/config/account1.js`**). The name of the config file doesn't matter but every account should have it's own config file.

## Dependencies
